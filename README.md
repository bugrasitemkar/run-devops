# Deploying .NET Microservices to Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) with Azure DevOps

This repository demonstrates how to build and deploy .NET-based microservices to Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), using Docker and Azure Container Registry (ACR), and automating deployments via Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines integrated with GitHub.

## üî≠ Overview

We will develop and deploy three core microservices:

- `Shopping.Client` (ASP.NET MVC)
- `Shopping.API` (ASP.NET Web API with MongoDB)
- `MongoDB` (NoSQL Database)

---

## üõç Shopping MVC Client Application

This is a standalone ASP.NET MVC web project that initially includes its own data. Key steps include:

- Dockerizing the application.
- Pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub.
- Deploying the container using **Azure Web App for Containers**.

Later, the client will consume the external Shopping API.

---

## üîå Shopping API Microservice

This ASP.NET Core Web API project:

- Manages product data using MongoDB.
- Exposes endpoints for the Shopping Client.
- Is containerized using a Dockerfile.
- Is pushed to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- Is deployed via **Kubernetes**.

---

## üóÉ MongoDB Microservice

MongoDB acts as the data source for the API service.

- MongoDB is pulled as a Docker image from Docker Hub.
- It is composed with other services using Docker Compose.
- Integration with the Shopping.API project is established.

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Local to Cloud Deployment

By the end of the project, you will have:

- Dockerized all microservices.
- Tested them locally using Docker Compose.
- Deployed them on a local Kubernetes cluster.
- Pushed all Docker images to ACR.
- Shifted deployments to Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
- Updated microservices with **zero-downtime deployments**.

---

## üöÄ CI/CD with Azure DevOps Pipelines

The final phase focuses on automation using Azure DevOps:

- Creating **CI/CD pipelines** for each microservice.
- Automating builds on **GitHub pushes**.
- Building Docker images and pushing them to **ACR**.
- Deploying to **AKS with zero downtime** using Kubernetes manifests and Azure Pipelines.
